# Spam-Email-Classification
SPAM E-mail Database  Spam includes ads, scams, chain letters, and more. Spam emails were collected from postmasters and user reports, while non-spam came from work and personal emails. Words like ‘george’ and area code ‘650’ indicate non-spam. To build a general spam filter, one must either ignore such indicators or use a diverse non-spam dataset.
